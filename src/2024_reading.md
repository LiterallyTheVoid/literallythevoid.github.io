## 2024 Reading

This isn't a "best of" list, nor is it meant to be one. This is the first year in a long time that I really got back into reading.

These are the books I read in 2024, along with some general thoughts.

If I didn't like a book, or I don't finish it, you will not find it on this list.

### [_Ninth House_](https://www.leighbardugo.com/book/ninth-house/) by Leigh Bardugo

My first read by Leigh Bardugo, and I will continue to read her. I
really loved the darkness and depth of the magic. The magic is very real
and very dangerous. I would recommend it if you enjoy fantasy and dark academia

### [_Hell Bent_](https://www.leighbardugo.com/book/hell-bent/) by Leigh Bardugo

The sequel to _Ninth House_. Not as good as the first, but still wonderful.

### [_The Complacent Class_](https://tylercowen.com/dd-product/the-complacent-class-the-self-defeating-quest-for-the-american-dream/) by Tyler Cowen

I don't remember much about this book other than a general sense of agreement.
Tyler is a deep and nuanced thinker with huge breadth.

### [_Shipwrecks_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1140987.Shipwrecks) by Akira Yoshimura

An extremely bleak atmospheric novel. It's ability to fill the reader with the
sense of dread is remarkable.

### [_Birds of Maine_](https://drawnandquarterly.com/books/birds-maine/) by Michael DeForge

An ambitious and beautiful graphic novel. It was very atmospheric. I wish it
pushed some of the themes more. For example, the notion that maps draw on us as
we draw maps is a deep insight that deserved more exploration.

### [_Mistborn Trilogy_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistborn:_The_Final_Empire) by Brandon Sanderson

Fantasy was what got me into reading, and Brandon Sanderson a contemporary noble
of the fantasy genre. Mistborn certainly lives up to the hype.

### [_Magic For Liars_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_for_Liars) by Sarah Gailey

A really fun novel featuring a non-magical detective at a magical school.

### [_When We Cease To Understand The World_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_We_Cease_to_Understand_the_World) by Benjam√≠n Labatut

On of the 100 most important novels of the 21st century according the to the
NYT. This novel deserves to remain on the list for the next 75 years.

### [_Opinions_](https://roxanegay.com/books/opinions-a-decade-of-arguments-criticism-and-minding-other-peoples-business/) by Roxane Gay

Sharp essays. Really great work.

### [_Number Go Up_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Go_Up) by Zeke Faux

Truly a wild ride about the ups and downs of crypto.

### [_What Moves The Dead_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Moves_the_Dead) by T. Kingfisher

A wonderful retelling of _The Fall of the House of Usher_. This novel has a
character that identifies with "va/van" pronouns. This clever device points out
the notion that gendered pronouns aren't inherent and that they/them singular
pronouns are just as "correct" as anything else.

### [_Waves_](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Waves/Ingrid-Chabbert/9781684153466) by Ingrid Chabbert, Illustrated by Carole Maurel

I grabbed this graphic novel based on the illustrations alone, and it certainly delivered. Beautiful and touching vignettes.

### [_The Vegetarian_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vegetarian) by Han Kang

This was a really excellent novel from this year's Nobel laureate. I'm sure that I will continue to read her work.
