## 2024 Reading

This isn't a best of list, nor is it meant to be. This is the first year in a long time that I really got back into reading.

These are the books I read in 2024, along with some general thoughts.

If I don't like a book, or I don't finish it, you will not find it on this list.

### _Ninth House_ by Leigh Bardugo

My first read by this particular author, and I will continue to read her. I
really loved the darkness and depth of the magic system. The magic is very real
and very dangerous. I would recommend it if you enjoy fantasy and dark academia

### _Hell Bent_ by Leigh Bardugo

The sequel to _Ninth House_. Not as good as the first, but still wonderful.

### _The Complacent Class_ by Tyler Cowen

I don't remember much about this book other than a general sense of agreement.
Tyler is a deep and nuanced thinker with huge breadth.

### _Shipwrecks_ by Akira Yoshimura

An extremely bleak atmospheric novel. It's ability to fill the reader with the
sense of dread felt by the characters is remarkable.

### _Birds of Maine_ by Michael DeForge

An ambitious and beautiful graphic novel. It was very atmospheric. I wish it
pushed some of the themes more. For example, the notion that maps draw on us as
we draw on maps is a deep insight that deserved more exploration.

### _Mistborn Trilogy_ by Brandon Sanderson

Fantasy was what got me into reading, and Brandon Sanderson a contemporary noble
of the fantasy genre. Mistborn certainly lives up to the hype.

### _Magic For Liars_ by Sarah Gailey

A really fun novel featuring a non-magical detective at a magical school.

### _When We Cease To Understand The World_ by Benjam√≠n Labatut

On of the 100 most important novels of the 21st century according the to the
NYT. This novel deserves to remain on the list for the next 75 years.

### _Opinions_ by Roxane Gay

Sharp essays. Really great work.

### _Number Go Up_ by Zeke Faux

Truly a wild ride about the ups and downs of crypto.

### _What Moves The Dead_ by T. Kingfisher

A wonderful retelling of _The Fall of the House of Usher_. This novel has a
character that identifies with "va/van" pronouns. This clever device points out
the notion that gendered pronouns aren't inherent and that they/them singular
pronouns are just as "correct" as anything else.
