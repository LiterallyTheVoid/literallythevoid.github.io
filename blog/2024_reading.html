      <h2>2024 Reading</h2>

      <p>
        This isn't a <q>best of</q> list, nor is it meant to be one. This is the
        first year in a long time that I really got back into reading.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are the books I read in 2024, along with some general thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        If I didn't like a book, or I don't finish it, you will not find it on
        this list.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.leighbardugo.com/book/ninth-house/"
          ><em>Ninth House</em></a
        >
        by Leigh Bardugo
      </h3>

      <p>
        My first read by Leigh Bardugo, and I will continue to read her. I
        really loved the darkness and depth of the magic. The magic is very real
        and very dangerous. I would recommend it if you enjoy fantasy and dark
        academia
      </p>

      <h3>

          ><em>Hell Bent</em></a
        >
        by Leigh Bardugo
      </h3>

      <p>
        The sequel to <em>Ninth House</em>. Not as good as the first, but still
        wonderful.
      </p>

          ><em>The Complacent Class</em></a
        >
        by Tyler Cowen
      </h3>

      <p>
        I don't remember much about this book other than a general sense of
        agreement. Tyler is a deep and nuanced thinker with huge breadth.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1140987.Shipwrecks"
          ><em>Shipwrecks</em></a
        >
        by Akira Yoshimura
      </h3>

      <p>
        An extremely bleak atmospheric novel. It's ability to fill the reader
        with the sense of dread is remarkable.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <a href="https://drawnandquarterly.com/books/birds-maine/"
          ><em>Birds of Maine</em></a
        >
        by Michael DeForge
      </h3>

      <p>
        An ambitious and beautiful graphic novel. It was very atmospheric. I
        wish it pushed some of the themes more. For example, the notion that
        maps draw on us as we draw maps is a deep insight that deserved more
        exploration.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistborn:_The_Final_Empire"
          ><em>Mistborn Trilogy</em></a
        >
        by Brandon Sanderson
      </h3>

      <p>
        Fantasy was what got me into reading, and Brandon Sanderson a
        contemporary noble of the fantasy genre. Mistborn certainly lives up to
        the hype.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_for_Liars"
          ><em>Magic For Liars</em></a
        >
        by Sarah Gailey
      </h3>

      <p>
        A really fun novel featuring a non-magical detective at a magical
        school.
      </p>

        by Benjam√≠n Labatut
      </h3>

      <p>
        On of the 100 most important novels of the 21st century according the to
        the NYT. This novel deserves to remain on the list for the next 75
        years.

      <p>Sharp essays. Really great work.</p>

          ><em>Number Go Up</em></a

      </h3>

      <p>Truly a wild ride about the ups and downs of crypto.</p>

        by T. Kingfisher
      </h3>

      <p>
        A wonderful retelling of <em>The Fall of the House of Usher</em>. This
        novel has a character that identifies with <q>va/van</q> pronouns. This
        clever device points out the notion that gendered pronouns aren't
        inherent and that they/them singular pronouns are just as
        <q>correct</q> as anything else.
      </p>

      <p>
        I grabbed this graphic novel based on the illustrations alone, and it
        certainly delivered. Beautiful and touching vignettes.

      <p>
        This was a really excellent novel from this year's Nobel laureate. I'm
        sure that I will continue to read her work.
