      <h2>Daily reading with Bash</h2>

      <p>
        I have a few sites that I like to visit every day to see if anything
        interesting was posted. I used a bookmarks folder where I could open all
        tabs at once, but managing the bookmarks was a bit of a pain, so I
        created a small Bash script instead. It's pretty basic. All it does is
        open all the sites that could have something interesting.
      </p>

      <p>The script below lives in <code>~/bin/</code>.</p>

      <pre>
        <code class="bash">
          #!/usr/bin/env bash

          open https://news.ycombinator.com/news;
          open https://animationobsessive.substack.com/;
          open https://lithub.com/category/lit-hub-daily/;
          # ... this is an abbreviated list
          # ... open whatever else you want

          exit 0;
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        Why does my script start with a comma?

        and it didn't seem like a terrible idea. I get tab completion, and I can
        see all my other functions.
      </p>

      <p>
        After opening, I can store relevant articles with
        <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a> for later.

        When I first got into programming, I didn't need to know all that much
        about Bash or the command line. I was able to do everything with basic,
        rote commands or a GUI. But sometime maturing as a programmer means
        accepting that the old heads were right--you should just be using Bash.
